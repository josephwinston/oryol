### NVIDIA Texture Tools

The tools **nvcompress**, **nvassemble**, **nvddsinfo** have been compiled from the
repository at:

https://github.com/floooh/nvidia-texture-tools

which is a fork of

https://github.com/casseveritt/nvidia-texture-tools

The nvcompress tool has been enhanced slightly to support more uncompressed RGBA formats in WebGL/OpenGLES component order.
